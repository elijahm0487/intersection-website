                <p align="justify">The most contentious topic in our society today, yet one of the most vital and uniquely impactful elements to our lives is undoubtedly: our faith. It's a subject that carries an immense volume of pending questions and continuing point
                    of views that are often left undiscussed, ignored or downplayed. Why couldn't there be a place where people could come together in peace to discuss these ideas safely? Imagine if there was a place where you would not be shunned for
                    what you believe, but instead encouraged to express yourself. What if there was a place where people could come together and discuss their varying views not to prove the other wrong, but to communicate what they believe freely? These
                    were the questions that inspired Elijah Matos, a Freshman student at the time, to make that place, a reality. Room 206 is the home to the Intersection. The place where anyone can come to discuss the Christian faith and bring in their
                    own questions, point of views, and beliefs, to have a conversation without any hostile opposition or restraint. A place where Christians and Non-christians come together. Everyoneâ€™s on their own path. We are the Intersection.</p>
